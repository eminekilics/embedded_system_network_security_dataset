Detecting anomalous network traffic using Python

# Network Traffic Anomaly Detection

This is a simple beginner-level project that combines cybersecurity and data analysis by detecting anomalous network traffic using Python.

-------

## Project Purpose

* Detect abnormal network traffic
* Practice data analysis in a cybersecurity context
* Apply an unsupervised machine learning model

-------

## Methodology

* Data preprocessing with pandas and NumPy
* Feature scaling using StandardScaler
* Anomaly detection with **Isolation Forest**
* Basic evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
* Simple feature comparison between normal and anomalous traffic

-------

## Tools & Technologies

* Python
* pandas
* NumPy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib

-------

## Dataset

* Kaggle: Network Traffic Anomaly Detection Dataset
* Labels are converted to binary format:

  * `0` → Normal
  * `1` → Anomaly

-------

## Output

* Classification report
* Confusion matrix
* Basic visualization of features related to anomalies
* CSV file containing high-risk traffic samples

-------

## Notes

This project was created for **learning purposes** and to gain hands-on experience in:

* Cybersecurity analytics
* Anomaly detection
* Python-based data analysis
